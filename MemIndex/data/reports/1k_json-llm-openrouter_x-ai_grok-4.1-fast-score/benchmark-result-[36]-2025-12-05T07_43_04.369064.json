No exact match in your described hometown landmarks (hospital, library 4km east of hospital, retail area 3km west of library, park 3km south of retail area, founder's statue 2km east of park), so it may be an additional or implied location like an orchard nearby.\n\n- **What to bring:** Seana Lynch instructed \"you must bring some tools for crossing a river,\" implying items for river traversal such as a **boat, raft, rope, bridge-building materials (e.g., planks, cables), inflatable raft, or wading gear (e.g., boots, poles)**. This suggests the meeting site may involve a river obstacle, possibly near the orchard. Bring multiples or redundants for safety/reliability.",
