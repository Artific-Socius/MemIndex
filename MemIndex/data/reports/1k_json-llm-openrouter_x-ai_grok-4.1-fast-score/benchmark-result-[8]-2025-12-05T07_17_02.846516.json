            "response": "### Meeting Details Based on Messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie:\n\n#### 1. **When the Meeting Might Take Place**:\n   - Dr. Arron Kelvey stated: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"\n   - This is a classic metaphorical reference to **noon** or **midday** (12:00 PM), when the sun reaches its zenith directly overhead in many locations (assuming a non-polar region with standard solar noon). \n   - Detail: Solar noon varies slightly by longitude and date (e.g., around 12:00 PM local solar time), but idiomatically, it means the middle of the day. No specific date was mentioned, so it could be the next available noon or a recurring event. In 2025 contexts (per timestamps), consider local time zone, but precisely **midday/noon**.\n\n#### 2. **Where the Meeting Might Be Held**:\n   - Lisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n   - This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or park with orchards.\n   - Detail: Apple trees imply a rural, agricultural, or natural setting suitable for growing fruit trees (temperate climate, e.g., regions like parts of the US, Europe, or China). No exact coordinates or named place given, but it evokes a peaceful, outdoor venue. Cross-referencing your hometown map (hospital center, library 4km east, retail 3km west of library ≈1km east of hospital, park 3km south of retail ≈1km E/-3km S, founder's statue 2km east of park ≈3km E/-3km S), no direct \"apple orchard\" matches, so it may be a separate or implied location (possibly symbolic for knowledge/fruitfulness, like Eden, but literally orchard).\n\n#### 3. **What You Might Need to Bring**:\n   - Seana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n   - Required: **Tools specifically for river crossing**, implying a water obstacle en route or at the site.\n   - Detailed possibilities (practical interpretations):\n     | Tool Type | Examples | Rationale |\n     |-----------|----------|-----------|\n     | **Boat/Floating** | Inflatable raft, canoe, kayak, or buoyant logs | For deep/flowing rivers; portable for hiking. |\n     | **Bridge-building** | Rope (nylon/paracord), planks/boards, poles, hammer/nails | To construct a temporary bridge or raft; survival-style. |\n     | **Wading/Fording** | Waders/boots, walking poles, life vest | For shallow rivers; stability and safety. |\n     | **Cable/Zip-line** | Grappling hook, pulley system, carabiners | For suspension crossing if banks are steep. |\n     | **Other Essentials** | Waterproof bag, first-aid kit, rope ladder | To protect items and ensure safety. |\n   - Detail: Suggests the meeting location (apple orchard) is isolated, across a river from access points. Bring multiples for group (assuming others attend). Prepare for currents, depth, weather—e.g., 20-50m rope, 2-4 planks (2x10ft). Not everyday tools; specialized for outdoor adventure.\n\n**Overall Synthesis**: The meeting is likely an outdoor, possibly covert or team-building event at a **noon** in an **apple orchard** across a **river**, requiring **river-crossing tools** (e.g., rope and planks for a raft/bridge). Combine clues for full picture—no contradictions. If more context (e.g., hometown map integration), the orchard might be near the founder's statue or park, but not specified. Prepare logistically for midday sun and water hazard.",

                "response": "### Meeting Details Based on Messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie:\n\n#### 1. **When the Meeting Might Take Place**:\n   - Dr. Arron Kelvey stated: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"\n   - This is a classic metaphorical reference to **noon** or **midday** (12:00 PM), when the sun reaches its zenith directly overhead in many locations (assuming a non-polar region with standard solar noon). \n   - Detail: Solar noon varies slightly by longitude and date (e.g., around 12:00 PM local solar time), but idiomatically, it means the middle of the day. No specific date was mentioned, so it could be the next available noon or a recurring event. In 2025 contexts (per timestamps), consider local time zone, but precisely **midday/noon**.\n\n#### 2. **Where the Meeting Might Be Held**:\n   - Lisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n   - This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or park with orchards.\n   - Detail: Apple trees imply a rural, agricultural, or natural setting suitable for growing fruit trees (temperate climate, e.g., regions like parts of the US, Europe, or China). No exact coordinates or named place given, but it evokes a peaceful, outdoor venue. Cross-referencing your hometown map (hospital center, library 4km east, retail 3km west of library ≈1km east of hospital, park 3km south of retail ≈1km E/-3km S, founder's statue 2km east of park ≈3km E/-3km S), no direct \"apple orchard\" matches, so it may be a separate or implied location (possibly symbolic for knowledge/fruitfulness, like Eden, but literally orchard).\n\n#### 3. **What You Might Need to Bring**:\n   - Seana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n   - Required: **Tools specifically for river crossing**, implying a water obstacle en route or at the site.\n   - Detailed possibilities (practical interpretations):\n     | Tool Type | Examples | Rationale |\n     |-----------|----------|-----------|\n     | **Boat/Floating** | Inflatable raft, canoe, kayak, or buoyant logs | For deep/flowing rivers; portable for hiking. |\n     | **Bridge-building** | Rope (nylon/paracord), planks/boards, poles, hammer/nails | To construct a temporary bridge or raft; survival-style. |\n     | **Wading/Fording** | Waders/boots, walking poles, life vest | For shallow rivers; stability and safety. |\n     | **Cable/Zip-line** | Grappling hook, pulley system, carabiners | For suspension crossing if banks are steep. |\n     | **Other Essentials** | Waterproof bag, first-aid kit, rope ladder | To protect items and ensure safety. |\n   - Detail: Suggests the meeting location (apple orchard) is isolated, across a river from access points. Bring multiples for group (assuming others attend). Prepare for currents, depth, weather—e.g., 20-50m rope, 2-4 planks (2x10ft). Not everyday tools; specialized for outdoor adventure.\n\n**Overall Synthesis**: The meeting is likely an outdoor, possibly covert or team-building event at a **noon** in an **apple orchard** across a **river**, requiring **river-crossing tools** (e.g., rope and planks for a raft/bridge). Combine clues for full picture—no contradictions. If more context (e.g., hometown map integration), the orchard might be near the founder's statue or park, but not specified. Prepare logistically for midday sun and water hazard.",
