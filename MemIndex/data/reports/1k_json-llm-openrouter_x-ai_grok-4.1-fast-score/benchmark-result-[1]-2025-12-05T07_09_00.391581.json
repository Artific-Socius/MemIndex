            "response": "### When the Meeting Might Take Place\nDr. Arron Kelvey's message: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"  \nThis is a classic riddle for **noon (12:00 PM)**. The sun reaches its highest point directly overhead at solar noon, which aligns with midday when the sun is \"high in the middle of the sky.\" This assumes a standard location without extreme latitudes affecting solar time, and it's a common metaphorical expression for midday.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis points to an **apple orchard** or **apple grove**. Apple trees are specifically associated with orchards where apples are cultivated. It's a literal reference to a location abundant in apple trees, evoking rural or farm-like settings. No other details tie it to specific landmarks (e.g., no apple-related places mentioned in hometown descriptions like hospital, library, retail area, park, or founder's statue).\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools suitable for bridging or traversing a river**, such as:  \n- **Planks, ropes, and poles** for building a makeshift bridge or raft.  \n- **A portable bridge kit**, grappling hook, or pulley system.  \n- Alternatives like a **foldable boat, inflatable raft, or wading poles** if the river is shallow/fordable.  \n- In a riddle context, it might imply **a bridge** itself (as \"tools for crossing\" could metaphorically mean bridge-building materials).  \nThe emphasis is on practical, portable tools for safe river crossing, suggesting the meeting location (apple orchard) is separated by a river, requiring preparation to attend.\n\nThese clues form a cohesive riddle: Meet at **noon** in an **apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools** (e.g., bridge/raft materials). No contradictions with other memory items (e.g., TV show, shopping list, restaurant, names, colors, jokes, quotes, or hometown map).",

                "response": "### When the Meeting Might Take Place\nDr. Arron Kelvey's message: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"  \nThis is a classic riddle for **noon (12:00 PM)**. The sun reaches its highest point directly overhead at solar noon, which aligns with midday when the sun is \"high in the middle of the sky.\" This assumes a standard location without extreme latitudes affecting solar time, and it's a common metaphorical expression for midday.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis points to an **apple orchard** or **apple grove**. Apple trees are specifically associated with orchards where apples are cultivated. It's a literal reference to a location abundant in apple trees, evoking rural or farm-like settings. No other details tie it to specific landmarks (e.g., no apple-related places mentioned in hometown descriptions like hospital, library, retail area, park, or founder's statue).\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools suitable for bridging or traversing a river**, such as:  \n- **Planks, ropes, and poles** for building a makeshift bridge or raft.  \n- **A portable bridge kit**, grappling hook, or pulley system.  \n- Alternatives like a **foldable boat, inflatable raft, or wading poles** if the river is shallow/fordable.  \n- In a riddle context, it might imply **a bridge** itself (as \"tools for crossing\" could metaphorically mean bridge-building materials).  \nThe emphasis is on practical, portable tools for safe river crossing, suggesting the meeting location (apple orchard) is separated by a river, requiring preparation to attend.\n\nThese clues form a cohesive riddle: Meet at **noon** in an **apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools** (e.g., bridge/raft materials). No contradictions with other memory items (e.g., TV show, shopping list, restaurant, names, colors, jokes, quotes, or hometown map).",
