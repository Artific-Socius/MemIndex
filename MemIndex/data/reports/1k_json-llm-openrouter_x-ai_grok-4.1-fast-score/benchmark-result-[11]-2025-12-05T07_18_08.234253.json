            "response": "### When the Meeting Might Take Place\nDr. Arron Kelvey's message states: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\" This is a classic riddle-like description referring to **noon (12:00 PM)**, as that is when the sun reaches its zenith (highest point) directly overhead in the middle of the sky during midday, assuming a location not too far from the equator or standard solar noon. It implies a precise, solar-time-based moment rather than clock time adjusted for time zones, emphasizing a natural, observable event. No other time details are provided, so it could be daily at noon, but context suggests a specific upcoming meeting.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation known for apple cultivation. It's poetic/riddle-style phrasing, evoking a rural, natural setting (e.g., \"orchard\" directly translates to where fruit trees like apples are grown). No specific address or tie to other landmarks (like the hometown map) is given in these messages, but it suggests an outdoor, verdant area, possibly seasonal (apple harvest time, e.g., fall). If metaphorical, it could allude to a place named \"Apple Orchard\" or similar, but literal interpretation fits best.\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's instruction: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, implying preparation for a water obstacle. Possible items include:\n- **Bridge-building materials**: Planks, ropes, hammers, nails, or pulleys to construct a temporary bridge.\n- **Navigation aids**: A boat, raft, inflatable dinghy, oars/paddles, life vest, or waterproof bag.\n- **Wading/ford tools**: Waders, poles for probing depth, grappling hooks, or cables/winches.\n- **Alternative interpretations**: If riddle-based, \"tools\" could pun on \"bridge\" (as a tool/structure for crossing), or survival gear like a rope ladder. Practical list: rope (50m+), tarp/planks for raft, knife/multi-tool, waterproof matches/flint for emergencies.\nIt's mandatory (\"must bring\"), suggesting the meeting site (apple orchard) is isolated by a river, requiring these to access. Bring multiples or redundants for safety/group size.\n\nThese clues form a coordinated puzzle: rendezvous at noon in an apple orchard, arriving via river-crossing tools. No contradictions among the three messages; they complement each other for a covert or adventure-style meeting.",

                "response": "### When the Meeting Might Take Place\nDr. Arron Kelvey's message states: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\" This is a classic riddle-like description referring to **noon (12:00 PM)**, as that is when the sun reaches its zenith (highest point) directly overhead in the middle of the sky during midday, assuming a location not too far from the equator or standard solar noon. It implies a precise, solar-time-based moment rather than clock time adjusted for time zones, emphasizing a natural, observable event. No other time details are provided, so it could be daily at noon, but context suggests a specific upcoming meeting.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation known for apple cultivation. It's poetic/riddle-style phrasing, evoking a rural, natural setting (e.g., \"orchard\" directly translates to where fruit trees like apples are grown). No specific address or tie to other landmarks (like the hometown map) is given in these messages, but it suggests an outdoor, verdant area, possibly seasonal (apple harvest time, e.g., fall). If metaphorical, it could allude to a place named \"Apple Orchard\" or similar, but literal interpretation fits best.\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's instruction: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, implying preparation for a water obstacle. Possible items include:\n- **Bridge-building materials**: Planks, ropes, hammers, nails, or pulleys to construct a temporary bridge.\n- **Navigation aids**: A boat, raft, inflatable dinghy, oars/paddles, life vest, or waterproof bag.\n- **Wading/ford tools**: Waders, poles for probing depth, grappling hooks, or cables/winches.\n- **Alternative interpretations**: If riddle-based, \"tools\" could pun on \"bridge\" (as a tool/structure for crossing), or survival gear like a rope ladder. Practical list: rope (50m+), tarp/planks for raft, knife/multi-tool, waterproof matches/flint for emergencies.\nIt's mandatory (\"must bring\"), suggesting the meeting site (apple orchard) is isolated by a river, requiring these to access. Bring multiples or redundants for safety/group size.\n\nThese clues form a coordinated puzzle: rendezvous at noon in an apple orchard, arriving via river-crossing tools. No contradictions among the three messages; they complement each other for a covert or adventure-style meeting.",
