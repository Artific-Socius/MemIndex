            "response": "### Meeting Details (Based on Messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie):\n\n#### **When might the meeting take place?**\n- Dr. Arron Kelvey specified: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"\n- This is a metaphorical or poetic reference to **noon (12:00 PM)**, as that is the time of day when the sun reaches its zenith (highest point directly overhead in the middle of the sky, assuming a location near the equator or during equinoxes for precision, but generally midday). It implies the peak of daylight, avoiding morning or afternoon shadows.\n\n#### **Where might it be held?**\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or garden known for apple cultivation. No specific geographic tie to your hometown landmarks (hospital, library, etc.) is mentioned, so it could be a dedicated orchard site, possibly rural or natural.\n\n#### **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**\n- Seana Lynch instructed: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- This requires **tools or equipment specifically for river crossing**, which could include:\n  - **Practical options**: A boat, raft, inflatable dinghy, canoe, or kayak; rope and pulley system; portable bridge materials (e.g., planks, cables); wading poles; life vest or flotation device; or even a simple rope ferry setup.\n  - **Interpretations**: \"Tools\" suggests man-made implements rather than natural aids (like stepping stones). It implies the meeting location (apple orchard) is separated from access by a river, necessitating preparation for water traversal. Safety gear (e.g., harnesses) or group tools (for multiple attendees) might be needed if collaborative.\n  - **Potential specifics**: In riddle-like contexts, it might hint at something idiomatic like \"a bridge\" (as a tool to cross), but the phrasing emphasizes portability (\"bring some tools\"), so likely compact, field-deployable items.\n\nThese details form a cohesive riddle: Meet at **noon** in an **apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools** to navigate any water barriers en route or on-site. No further constraints (e.g., weather, confirmation) were provided.",

                "response": "### Meeting Details (Based on Messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie):\n\n#### **When might the meeting take place?**\n- Dr. Arron Kelvey specified: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"\n- This is a metaphorical or poetic reference to **noon (12:00 PM)**, as that is the time of day when the sun reaches its zenith (highest point directly overhead in the middle of the sky, assuming a location near the equator or during equinoxes for precision, but generally midday). It implies the peak of daylight, avoiding morning or afternoon shadows.\n\n#### **Where might it be held?**\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or garden known for apple cultivation. No specific geographic tie to your hometown landmarks (hospital, library, etc.) is mentioned, so it could be a dedicated orchard site, possibly rural or natural.\n\n#### **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**\n- Seana Lynch instructed: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- This requires **tools or equipment specifically for river crossing**, which could include:\n  - **Practical options**: A boat, raft, inflatable dinghy, canoe, or kayak; rope and pulley system; portable bridge materials (e.g., planks, cables); wading poles; life vest or flotation device; or even a simple rope ferry setup.\n  - **Interpretations**: \"Tools\" suggests man-made implements rather than natural aids (like stepping stones). It implies the meeting location (apple orchard) is separated from access by a river, necessitating preparation for water traversal. Safety gear (e.g., harnesses) or group tools (for multiple attendees) might be needed if collaborative.\n  - **Potential specifics**: In riddle-like contexts, it might hint at something idiomatic like \"a bridge\" (as a tool to cross), but the phrasing emphasizes portability (\"bring some tools\"), so likely compact, field-deployable items.\n\nThese details form a cohesive riddle: Meet at **noon** in an **apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools** to navigate any water barriers en route or on-site. No further constraints (e.g., weather, confirmation) were provided.",
