This is a classic metaphorical description for midday solar position.\n\n#### **Where (Location):**\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- **Interpretation:** This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a fruit farm, grove, or orchard where apples are cultivated. No specific address or coordinates are given, but it's a natural, rural, or agricultural setting characterized by apple tree growth.\n\n#### **What to Bring:**\n- Seana Lynch: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- **Interpretation:** Essential items are **tools specifically for crossing a river**, implying equipment for water traversal. Possible examples (not exhaustive, as not specified further):\n  - **Bridging tools:** Planks, ropes, poles, or a portable bridge kit to construct a temporary crossing.\n  - **Boating/ferrying tools:** Oars, a collapsible raft, inflatable boat, or punt pole.\n  - **Wading tools:** Waders, grappling hooks, or a ford pole to test depth/current.\n  - **Other practical tools:** Life vest, rope ladder, or winch for safe river navigation.\n  - Purpose: Likely to overcome a river barrier en route to or at the meeting site (potentially near the apple orchard). Without these, attendance is not possible.\n\nThese clues form a coordinated riddle-like invitation: Meet at **noon in an apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools**. No additional context (e.g., exact coordinates, confirmations, or ties to other info like your hometown landmarks) is provided in their messages.",

This is a classic metaphorical description for midday solar position.\n\n#### **Where (Location):**\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- **Interpretation:** This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a fruit farm, grove, or orchard where apples are cultivated. No specific address or coordinates are given, but it's a natural, rural, or agricultural setting characterized by apple tree growth.\n\n#### **What to Bring:**\n- Seana Lynch: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- **Interpretation:** Essential items are **tools specifically for crossing a river**, implying equipment for water traversal. Possible examples (not exhaustive, as not specified further):\n  - **Bridging tools:** Planks, ropes, poles, or a portable bridge kit to construct a temporary crossing.\n  - **Boating/ferrying tools:** Oars, a collapsible raft, inflatable boat, or punt pole.\n  - **Wading tools:** Waders, grappling hooks, or a ford pole to test depth/current.\n  - **Other practical tools:** Life vest, rope ladder, or winch for safe river navigation.\n  - Purpose: Likely to overcome a river barrier en route to or at the meeting site (potentially near the apple orchard). Without these, attendance is not possible.\n\nThese clues form a coordinated riddle-like invitation: Meet at **noon in an apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools**. No additional context (e.g., exact coordinates, confirmations, or ties to other info like your hometown landmarks) is provided in their messages.",
