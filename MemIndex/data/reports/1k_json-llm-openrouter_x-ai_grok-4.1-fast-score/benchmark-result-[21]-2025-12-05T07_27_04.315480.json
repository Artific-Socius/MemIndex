No exact coordinates tie directly to the hometown map (hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue), but it evokes a natural, rural, or landscaped area with orchards.\n\n**What to bring:** Seana Lynch stated, \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies items essential for traversing water, such as:\n- A small inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat for ferrying across.\n- Rope, grappling hook, or pulley system for makeshift bridging.\n- Wading poles, sturdy walking sticks, or boots for shallow fording.\n- A portable inflatable bridge kit, stepping stones, or planks for temporary crossing.\n- Life vest, waterproof bag for essentials, or signaling device (whistle/flare) for safety.\nThese \"tools\" suggest preparation for a physical barrier like a stream, creek, or wider river, emphasizing practicality and possibly teamwork in assembly/use.

No exact coordinates tie directly to the hometown map (hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue), but it evokes a natural, rural, or landscaped area with orchards.\n\n**What to bring:** Seana Lynch stated, \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies items essential for traversing water, such as:\n- A small inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat for ferrying across.\n- Rope, grappling hook, or pulley system for makeshift bridging.\n- Wading poles, sturdy walking sticks, or boots for shallow fording.\n- A portable inflatable bridge kit, stepping stones, or planks for temporary crossing.\n- Life vest, waterproof bag for essentials, or signaling device (whistle/flare) for safety.\nThese \"tools\" suggest preparation for a physical barrier like a stream, creek, or wider river, emphasizing practicality and possibly teamwork in assembly/use.
