This suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a fruit farm, grove, or orchard area known for apple cultivation.\n\n- **What to bring:** \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river\" (Seana Lynch). This implies items essential for traversing water, such as a **boat, raft, inflatable dinghy, rope, bridge-building materials (e.g., planks, poles), wading poles, or even a portable bridge kit**. The exact tools depend on the river's size and conditions (e.g., shallow ford might need just boots or a pole; deeper flow might require a full raft), but they must enable safe crossing to ensure attendance.\n\nThese clues form a coordinated riddle-like instruction from the three individuals, pointing to a specific, potentially remote outdoor meeting requiring preparation for natural obstacles.

This indicates **noon or midday**, as that's when the sun reaches its highest point directly overhead in the sky, typically around 12:00 PM solar time.\n\n- **Where:** \"We will meet where the apple trees grow\" (Lisa-Marie Hastie). This suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a fruit farm, grove, or orchard area known for apple cultivation.\n\n- **What to bring:** \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river\" (Seana Lynch). This implies items essential for traversing water, such as a **boat, raft, inflatable dinghy, rope, bridge-building materials (e.g., planks, poles), wading poles, or even a portable bridge kit**. The exact tools depend on the river's size and conditions (e.g., shallow ford might need just boots or a pole; deeper flow might require a full raft), but they must enable safe crossing to ensure attendance.\n\nThese clues form a coordinated riddle-like instruction from the three individuals, pointing to a specific, potentially remote outdoor meeting requiring preparation for natural obstacles.
