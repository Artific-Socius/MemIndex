In 2025 (current context), without specific timezone, it's precisely **noon local time**.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- This points to an **apple orchard** or **apple grove**—a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, plantation, or wooded area dedicated to apple cultivation.\n- No exact coordinates tie directly to your hometown geography (hospital center, library 4km east, retail 3km west of library, park 3km south of retail, founder's statue 2km east of park), but it evokes a rural or natural spot possibly near these (e.g., an orchard south/east if patterned). It's riddle-like, implying a specific, identifiable place known to the group.\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- **Tools for crossing a river** suggest items enabling safe traversal of water, such as:\n  - **Boat/raft**: Inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat with oars/paddles for ferrying across.\n  - **Bridge-building materials**: Rope, planks, poles, or portable bridge kit (e.g., engineer’s tools like cables, struts).\n  - **Fording aids**: Wading poles, grappling hooks, inflatable vest, or stepping stones.\n  - **Alternative interpretations**: In riddle contexts, could mean \"bridge\" (as a tool/structure), boat hooks, or even a \"punt\" pole. Practical list: life jacket, rope ladder, waterproof bag for gear.\n- Purpose: Implies the meeting site (apple orchard) is separated by a river, requiring these to access. Bring multiples or redundants for group safety.\n\n**Synthesis**: Meeting at **noon** in an **apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools** (e.g., boat + oars). These clues form a coordinated riddle from the three individuals, possibly testing preparation or insider knowledge. No other details contradict this.",

In 2025 (current context), without specific timezone, it's precisely **noon local time**.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- This points to an **apple orchard** or **apple grove**—a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, plantation, or wooded area dedicated to apple cultivation.\n- No exact coordinates tie directly to your hometown geography (hospital center, library 4km east, retail 3km west of library, park 3km south of retail, founder's statue 2km east of park), but it evokes a rural or natural spot possibly near these (e.g., an orchard south/east if patterned). It's riddle-like, implying a specific, identifiable place known to the group.\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- **Tools for crossing a river** suggest items enabling safe traversal of water, such as:\n  - **Boat/raft**: Inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat with oars/paddles for ferrying across.\n  - **Bridge-building materials**: Rope, planks, poles, or portable bridge kit (e.g., engineer’s tools like cables, struts).\n  - **Fording aids**: Wading poles, grappling hooks, inflatable vest, or stepping stones.\n  - **Alternative interpretations**: In riddle contexts, could mean \"bridge\" (as a tool/structure), boat hooks, or even a \"punt\" pole. Practical list: life jacket, rope ladder, waterproof bag for gear.\n- Purpose: Implies the meeting site (apple orchard) is separated by a river, requiring these to access. Bring multiples or redundants for group safety.\n\n**Synthesis**: Meeting at **noon** in an **apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools** (e.g., boat + oars). These clues form a coordinated riddle from the three individuals, possibly testing preparation or insider knowledge. No other details contradict this.",
