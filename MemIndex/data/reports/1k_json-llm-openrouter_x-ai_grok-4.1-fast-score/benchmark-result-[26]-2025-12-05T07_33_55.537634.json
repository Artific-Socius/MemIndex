            "response": "### When the Meeting Might Take Place\nDr. Arron Kelvey's message states: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"  \nThis is a poetic reference to **noon (12:00 PM)**, as the sun reaches its highest point directly overhead at midday in most locations (solar noon, approximately when the sun is at zenith). This assumes a standard equatorial or temperate timezone without extreme seasonal variations, and it's the most literal and common interpretation of the phrase.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation known for apple cultivation. Apple trees are typically found in rural or agricultural areas with suitable climates (cooler temperate regions). It evokes a natural, outdoor setting, possibly idyllic or symbolic (e.g., like in folklore or literature where orchards represent abundance or secrecy).\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools or equipment specifically for traversing a body of water**, implying the meeting site is separated by a river or stream. Possible items include:  \n- **A portable bridge** (e.g., folding or rope bridge for spanning gaps).  \n- **Boat or raft** (inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat for ferrying across).  \n- **Wading/crossing aids** (waders, poles for probing depth, grappling hook/rope for pulling across).  \n- **Other practical tools**: Life vest for safety, tow rope, or even a simple plank if shallow.  \nThe emphasis on \"tools\" suggests man-made implements rather than natural methods (e.g., not just swimming), and \"some\" implies multiples or a kit, preparing for a potentially challenging or wide crossing. This could indicate the orchard is on the opposite riverbank from the access point.",

This assumes a standard equatorial or temperate timezone without extreme seasonal variations, and it's the most literal and common interpretation of the phrase.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation known for apple cultivation. Apple trees are typically found in rural or agricultural areas with suitable climates (cooler temperate regions). It evokes a natural, outdoor setting, possibly idyllic or symbolic (e.g., like in folklore or literature where orchards represent abundance or secrecy).\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools or equipment specifically for traversing a body of water**, implying the meeting site is separated by a river or stream. Possible items include:  \n- **A portable bridge** (e.g., folding or rope bridge for spanning gaps).  \n- **Boat or raft** (inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat for ferrying across).  \n- **Wading/crossing aids** (waders, poles for probing depth, grappling hook/rope for pulling across).  \n- **Other practical tools**: Life vest for safety, tow rope, or even a simple plank if shallow.  \nThe emphasis on \"tools\" suggests man-made implements rather than natural methods (e.g., not just swimming), and \"some\" implies multiples or a kit, preparing for a potentially challenging or wide crossing. This could indicate the orchard is on the opposite riverbank from the access point.",
