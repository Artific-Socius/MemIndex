            "response": "### Meeting Details Based on the Messages\n\nThank you for the query! I've carefully analyzed the three messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie to piece together the details about the meeting. Here's a breakdown **in as much detail as possible**, including direct quotes from each message, my logical inferences, potential context, and any preparations needed. I'll structure it around your specific questions for clarity.\n\n#### 1. **When might the meeting take place?**\n   - **Key Message**: Dr. Arron Kelvey said: *\"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"*\n   - **Detailed Inference**:\n     - This is a classic poetic or riddle-like description of **noon (12:00 PM)**. The sun reaches its highest point directly overhead (or \"high in the middle of the sky\") at midday in most locations, assuming standard solar time without daylight saving adjustments.\n     - Context: This aligns with natural timekeeping (solar noon), which could be literal for an outdoor meeting or symbolic in a scenario emphasizing simplicity. If we're in a specific timezone (not specified), it would be local solar noon, roughly 12 PM.\n     - Precision: It implies punctuality—\"right on time\" when the sun is at its zenith. No minutes or seconds are given, so arrive by 12:00 PM sharp to avoid missing it.\n     - Potential Variations: In winter or far northern/southern latitudes, solar noon shifts slightly (e.g., by 10-15 minutes), but the intent is clearly midday.\n\n#### 2. **Where might it be held?**\n   - **Key Message**: Lisa-Marie Hastie said: *\"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"*\n   - **Detailed Inference**:\n     - This points to an **apple orchard** (or apple grove/farm where apple trees are cultivated in abundance).\n     - Context: Apple trees \"grow\" in orchards, which are open, rural areas ideal for meetings. It evokes a picturesque, natural setting—perhaps a specific local orchard known for its trees. No exact address is given, but it's likely accessible and recognizable by the apple trees.\n     - Cross-Reference: This fits with the river-crossing tools (from Seana's message), suggesting the orchard might be near a river or body of water that needs crossing to reach it.\n     - Potential Details: Look for a spot with ripe or blooming apple trees (season-dependent). If this ties into prior context (like a hometown hospital), it could be a nearby landmark, but based solely on these messages, it's the apple orchard.\n\n#### 3. **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**\n   - **Key Message**: Seana Lynch said: *\"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"*\n   - **Detailed Inference**:\n     - **Mandatory Items**: Tools specifically for **crossing a river**, implying a water obstacle between you and the meeting spot (apple orchard). This could be a shallow ford, deep stream, or wider river—preparation is essential for safety and attendance.\n     - **Recommended Toolkit** (practical, detailed list based on common river-crossing methods):\n       | Tool/Item          | Purpose                                                                 | Why Essential? |\n       |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n       | **Sturdy Rope (e.g., 20-30m nylon or climbing rope)** | Tying to a tree for a handline, securing a raft, or belaying swimmers. | Versatile for improvised bridges or rescues. |\n       | **Axe or Machete** | Clearing branches/trees for raft-building, cutting vines, or trailblazing to the riverbank. | Enables quick construction of crossing aids. |\n       | **Oars or Poles (2-3 sturdy wooden poles)** | Propelling a raft, testing water depth, or poling across shallows. | Critical for controlled movement over water. |\n       | **Life Preserver/PFD (personal flotation device)** | Buoyancy for swimming or raft stability; includes whistle for signaling. | Safety first—prevents drowning in currents. |\n       | **Additional Essentials**: Waterproof bag (for dry clothes/phone), sturdy boots (for slippery banks), first-aid kit (bandages, antiseptic for cuts), and a tarp/plastic sheet (for raft base or shelter). | Covers emergencies like injury, weather, or gear failure. |\n     - **Preparation Tips**:\n       - Pack in a backpack for easy carry.\n       - Test tools beforehand (e.g., rope strength >500kg).\n       - Consider group size—scale up for multiple people.\n       - Alternatives if no tools: Swim (risky), wait for low water, or find a bridge—but the message mandates **tools** for attendance.\n     - Context: This suggests an adventurous or remote location, combining with the orchard for a nature-based rendezvous.\n\n#### Overall Summary & Logistics\n- **Full Picture**: Meet at the **apple orchard** at **noon**, but first cross a **river** using specialized **tools** (rope, axe, oars, life preserver, etc.).\n- **Step-by-Step Plan**:\n  1. Gather river-crossing tools early morning.\n  2. Travel to the river (location inferred near the orchard).\n  3. Cross safely.\n  4. Proceed to the apple orchard by 12:00 PM.\n- **Risks/Notes**: Weather could affect sun position or river levels—check forecasts. This feels like a riddle or team-building event; confirm with senders if possible.\n\nIf this matches a TV show plot, prior hometown details, or shopping list (none seem directly related here), let me know for more ties!

                "response": "### Meeting Details Based on the Messages\n\nThank you for the query! I've carefully analyzed the three messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie to piece together the details about the meeting. Here's a breakdown **in as much detail as possible**, including direct quotes from each message, my logical inferences, potential context, and any preparations needed. I'll structure it around your specific questions for clarity.\n\n#### 1. **When might the meeting take place?**\n   - **Key Message**: Dr. Arron Kelvey said: *\"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"*\n   - **Detailed Inference**:\n     - This is a classic poetic or riddle-like description of **noon (12:00 PM)**. The sun reaches its highest point directly overhead (or \"high in the middle of the sky\") at midday in most locations, assuming standard solar time without daylight saving adjustments.\n     - Context: This aligns with natural timekeeping (solar noon), which could be literal for an outdoor meeting or symbolic in a scenario emphasizing simplicity. If we're in a specific timezone (not specified), it would be local solar noon, roughly 12 PM.\n     - Precision: It implies punctuality—\"right on time\" when the sun is at its zenith. No minutes or seconds are given, so arrive by 12:00 PM sharp to avoid missing it.\n     - Potential Variations: In winter or far northern/southern latitudes, solar noon shifts slightly (e.g., by 10-15 minutes), but the intent is clearly midday.\n\n#### 2. **Where might it be held?**\n   - **Key Message**: Lisa-Marie Hastie said: *\"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"*\n   - **Detailed Inference**:\n     - This points to an **apple orchard** (or apple grove/farm where apple trees are cultivated in abundance).\n     - Context: Apple trees \"grow\" in orchards, which are open, rural areas ideal for meetings. It evokes a picturesque, natural setting—perhaps a specific local orchard known for its trees. No exact address is given, but it's likely accessible and recognizable by the apple trees.\n     - Cross-Reference: This fits with the river-crossing tools (from Seana's message), suggesting the orchard might be near a river or body of water that needs crossing to reach it.\n     - Potential Details: Look for a spot with ripe or blooming apple trees (season-dependent). If this ties into prior context (like a hometown hospital), it could be a nearby landmark, but based solely on these messages, it's the apple orchard.\n\n#### 3. **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**\n   - **Key Message**: Seana Lynch said: *\"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"*\n   - **Detailed Inference**:\n     - **Mandatory Items**: Tools specifically for **crossing a river**, implying a water obstacle between you and the meeting spot (apple orchard). This could be a shallow ford, deep stream, or wider river—preparation is essential for safety and attendance.\n     - **Recommended Toolkit** (practical, detailed list based on common river-crossing methods):\n       | Tool/Item          | Purpose                                                                 | Why Essential? |\n       |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n       | **Sturdy Rope (e.g., 20-30m nylon or climbing rope)** | Tying to a tree for a handline, securing a raft, or belaying swimmers. | Versatile for improvised bridges or rescues. |\n       | **Axe or Machete** | Clearing branches/trees for raft-building, cutting vines, or trailblazing to the riverbank. | Enables quick construction of crossing aids. |\n       | **Oars or Poles (2-3 sturdy wooden poles)** | Propelling a raft, testing water depth, or poling across shallows. | Critical for controlled movement over water. |\n       | **Life Preserver/PFD (personal flotation device)** | Buoyancy for swimming or raft stability; includes whistle for signaling. | Safety first—prevents drowning in currents. |\n       | **Additional Essentials**: Waterproof bag (for dry clothes/phone), sturdy boots (for slippery banks), first-aid kit (bandages, antiseptic for cuts), and a tarp/plastic sheet (for raft base or shelter). | Covers emergencies like injury, weather, or gear failure. |\n     - **Preparation Tips**:\n       - Pack in a backpack for easy carry.\n       - Test tools beforehand (e.g., rope strength >500kg).\n       - Consider group size—scale up for multiple people.\n       - Alternatives if no tools: Swim (risky), wait for low water, or find a bridge—but the message mandates **tools** for attendance.\n     - Context: This suggests an adventurous or remote location, combining with the orchard for a nature-based rendezvous.\n\n#### Overall Summary & Logistics\n- **Full Picture**: Meet at the **apple orchard** at **noon**, but first cross a **river** using specialized **tools** (rope, axe, oars, life preserver, etc.).\n- **Step-by-Step Plan**:\n  1. Gather river-crossing tools early morning.\n  2. Travel to the river (location inferred near the orchard).\n  3. Cross safely.\n  4. Proceed to the apple orchard by 12:00 PM.\n- **Risks/Notes**: Weather could affect sun position or river levels—check forecasts. This feels like a riddle or team-building event; confirm with senders if possible.\n\nIf this matches a TV show plot, prior hometown details, or shopping list (none seem directly related here), let me know for more ties! Excited to \"attend\"—what's next? 🍎🌊☀️",
