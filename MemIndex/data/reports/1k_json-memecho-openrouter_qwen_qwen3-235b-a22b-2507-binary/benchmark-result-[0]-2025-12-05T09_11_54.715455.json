            "response": "Based on the messages received from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie, here is a detailed synthesis of the meeting details:\n\n**When the meeting will take place:**  \nAccording to Dr. Arron Kelvey, the meeting will occur \"when the sun is high in the middle of the sky,\" which clearly refers to **noon**—the midpoint of the day when the sun reaches its highest point. Therefore, the meeting is scheduled for **12:00 PM (midday)**.\n\n**Where the meeting will be held:**  \nLisa-Marie Hastie stated, \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This indicates that the meeting location is a place characterized by the presence of **apple trees**. This could be an **orchard, a rural grove, a garden, or a natural area** known for apple cultivation. The setting is likely outdoors and possibly secluded or symbolic, given the poetic phrasing.\n\n**What you need to bring to attend the meeting:**  \nSeana Lynch specified, \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies that the location—where apple trees grow—is not easily accessible and requires crossing a river to reach. Therefore, you should bring **practical tools or equipment that facilitate river crossing**, such as:\n- A **rope** (for securing a line across currents),\n- **Sturdy boots** or **waders**,\n- A **walking stick** for balance,\n- Possibly a **raft** or **inflatable device** if the river is wide,\n- Or even symbolic \"tools\" like knowledge of safe fording points.\n\nThe need for such tools suggests the meeting site is **remote and natural**, reinforcing the likelihood of a wooded or rural orchard near a flowing river.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe meeting will take place **at noon**, at a **location where apple trees grow—likely an orchard or grove near a river**, and attendees must **bring tools to cross a river** to reach it. The imagery evokes a ritualistic or symbolic gathering in nature, combining precise timing with physical preparation.",

Therefore, the meeting is scheduled for **12:00 PM (midday)**.\n\n**Where the meeting will be held:**  \nLisa-Marie Hastie stated, \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This indicates that the meeting location is a place characterized by the presence of **apple trees**. This could be an **orchard, a rural grove, a garden, or a natural area** known for apple cultivation. The setting is likely outdoors and possibly secluded or symbolic, given the poetic phrasing.\n\n**What you need to bring to attend the meeting:**  \nSeana Lynch specified, \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies that the location—where apple trees grow—is not easily accessible and requires crossing a river to reach. Therefore, you should bring **practical tools or equipment that facilitate river crossing**, such as:\n- A **rope** (for securing a line across currents),\n- **Sturdy boots** or **waders**,\n- A **walking stick** for balance,\n- Possibly a **raft** or **inflatable device** if the river is wide,\n- Or even symbolic \"tools\" like knowledge of safe fording points.\n\nThe need for such tools suggests the meeting site is **remote and natural**, reinforcing the likelihood of a wooded or rural orchard near a flowing river.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe meeting will take place **at noon**, at a **location where apple trees grow—likely an orchard or grove near a river**, and attendees must **bring tools to cross a river** to reach it. The imagery evokes a ritualistic or symbolic gathering in nature, combining precise timing with physical preparation.",
