I have responded to your requests for food orders, and have been instructed to say \"Resist temptation, stick to your diet plan\" when you express a desire for sweets. I have also processed trivia questions and answers, extracting the answers into a JSON list. I have been asked to forget and then re-confirm previous instructions regarding names, places, and shopping lists. I was also asked to remember the instruction to include a Ralph Waldo Emerson quote in my fourth message, and then later told to forget that instruction, and then finally asked to retract the forgetting of that instruction and identify when I was first asked to include the quote.
