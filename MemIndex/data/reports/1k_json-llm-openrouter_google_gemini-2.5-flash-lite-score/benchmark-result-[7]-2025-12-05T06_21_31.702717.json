However, the ground truth states that the correct response is to order *another* dish, implying a previous order or context that is missing. Without that context, simply ordering a dish is a plausible but not definitively complete answer according to the strict interpretation of 'another dish'. Since the answer does select a dish from the menu, it's partially correct. However, the prompt asks for a score between 0 and 1, and 'fully correct' is 1. Any deviation or omission should result in a deduction. Given the ambiguity of 'another dish' without prior context, and the fact that a dish *was* ordered, I will assign a score that reflects partial correctness.",
