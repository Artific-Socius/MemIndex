This is a classic riddle-like reference to midday, when the sun reaches its zenith directly overhead (assuming a location not too far from the equator and clear weather). \"High in the middle of the sky\" evokes solar noon, the point of maximum solar elevation, typically around 12 PM local solar time, adjusted slightly for time zones and longitude.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message—\"We will meet where the apple trees grow\"—points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation dedicated to apple cultivation. This could be a rural or suburban orchard setting, possibly in a valley or hillside ideal for apple growth (cooler climates with good soil). No specific hometown landmarks match this directly from prior details (e.g., hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue), suggesting it might be outside the mapped hometown area or a metaphorical \"orchard\" spot.\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's message—\"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river\"—requires **tools or equipment specifically for river traversal**. Possible interpretations include:\n- **Boat, raft, or canoe**: Inflatable raft, kayak, or rowboat for ferrying across water.\n- **Bridge-building materials**: Rope, planks, poles, or a portable bridge kit (e.g., for constructing a simple footbridge).\n- **Fording aids**: Waders, waterproof boots, grappling hook, or pulley system.\n- **Other practical items**: Life vest, paddle, anchor, or even a vehicle like an amphibious craft if motorized.\n\nThis implies the meeting location (apple orchard) is separated from the access point by a river, necessitating these items for safe crossing. Bring multiples or redundancies (e.g., extra rope) for reliability, and consider weather/water conditions (e.g., current speed, depth). Failure to bring them would prevent attendance, per the instruction.",

This is a classic riddle-like reference to midday, when the sun reaches its zenith directly overhead (assuming a location not too far from the equator and clear weather). \"High in the middle of the sky\" evokes solar noon, the point of maximum solar elevation, typically around 12 PM local solar time, adjusted slightly for time zones and longitude.\n\n### Where the Meeting Might Be Held\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message—\"We will meet where the apple trees grow\"—points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation dedicated to apple cultivation. This could be a rural or suburban orchard setting, possibly in a valley or hillside ideal for apple growth (cooler climates with good soil). No specific hometown landmarks match this directly from prior details (e.g., hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue), suggesting it might be outside the mapped hometown area or a metaphorical \"orchard\" spot.\n\n### What You Might Need to Bring\nSeana Lynch's message—\"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river\"—requires **tools or equipment specifically for river traversal**. Possible interpretations include:\n- **Boat, raft, or canoe**: Inflatable raft, kayak, or rowboat for ferrying across water.\n- **Bridge-building materials**: Rope, planks, poles, or a portable bridge kit (e.g., for constructing a simple footbridge).\n- **Fording aids**: Waders, waterproof boots, grappling hook, or pulley system.\n- **Other practical items**: Life vest, paddle, anchor, or even a vehicle like an amphibious craft if motorized.\n\nThis implies the meeting location (apple orchard) is separated from the access point by a river, necessitating these items for safe crossing. Bring multiples or redundancies (e.g., extra rope) for reliability, and consider weather/water conditions (e.g., current speed, depth). Failure to bring them would prevent attendance, per the instruction.",
