This is the time when the sun reaches its zenith (highest point) directly overhead in many locations, especially near the equator or during equinoxes, symbolizing midday. It's a classic riddle for noon, as \"high noon\" is a common phrase for this solar position.\n\n### Where might it be held?\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message—\"We will meet where the apple trees grow\"—suggests an **apple orchard** or apple grove. This is a place naturally associated with apple trees, evoking rural or farm settings where orchards are cultivated for fruit production. It could be a literal orchard, a park/orchard hybrid, or even a symbolic \"Big Apple\" reference (unlikely, as it specifies trees growing apples), but the most direct interpretation is a dedicated apple orchard.\n\n### What might you need to bring?\nSeana Lynch's instruction—\"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river\"—implies **items or equipment specifically for river traversal**. Possible detailed interpretations include:\n- **Boat or raft-building materials**: Such as oars, a small inflatable boat, wooden planks, rope, or a foldable canoe to float across.\n- **Bridge-building tools**: Hammer, nails, planks, ropes, or portable bridge sections (e.g., for a simple rope bridge or pontoon).\n- **Wading/pole tools**: A long pole (for poling across shallows or testing depth), hip waders, or grappling hook with rope.\n- **Alternative riddle solutions**: Could be \"stepping stones,\" a \"ferry ticket,\" or even \"swimming gear\" (goggles, floatation device), but \"tools\" suggests man-made implements rather than natural aids.\nThese would ensure safe passage over water, assuming a physical river barrier at the meeting site (potentially near the orchard).

This is a place naturally associated with apple trees, evoking rural or farm settings where orchards are cultivated for fruit production. It could be a literal orchard, a park/orchard hybrid, or even a symbolic \"Big Apple\" reference (unlikely, as it specifies trees growing apples), but the most direct interpretation is a dedicated apple orchard.\n\n### What might you need to bring?\nSeana Lynch's instruction—\"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river\"—implies **items or equipment specifically for river traversal**. Possible detailed interpretations include:\n- **Boat or raft-building materials**: Such as oars, a small inflatable boat, wooden planks, rope, or a foldable canoe to float across.\n- **Bridge-building tools**: Hammer, nails, planks, ropes, or portable bridge sections (e.g., for a simple rope bridge or pontoon).\n- **Wading/pole tools**: A long pole (for poling across shallows or testing depth), hip waders, or grappling hook with rope.\n- **Alternative riddle solutions**: Could be \"stepping stones,\" a \"ferry ticket,\" or even \"swimming gear\" (goggles, floatation device), but \"tools\" suggests man-made implements rather than natural aids.\nThese would ensure safe passage over water, assuming a physical river barrier at the meeting site (potentially near the orchard).
