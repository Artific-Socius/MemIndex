            "response": "### When might the meeting take place?\nDr. Arron Kelvey stated: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\" This is a classic riddle-like description pointing to **noon (12:00 PM)**, as that's when the sun reaches its highest point directly overhead in the sky (zenith) during midday, assuming a location not too far from the equator and clear weather. This aligns with solar noon, typically around 12 PM local time, symbolizing the peak of the day.\n\n### Where might it be held?\nLisa-Marie Hastie said: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, garden, or park featuring apple groves. It evokes a rural or natural setting where apple cultivation is prominent (e.g., an orchard). No specific tie to your mentioned hometown landmarks (hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue), so it remains a general natural/agricultural venue unless \"apple trees\" is code for something else like a named place.\n\n### What might you need to bring?\nSeana Lynch instructed: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies practical items for water traversal, such as:\n- **Bridge-building tools**: Rope, planks, hammers, nails (to construct a simple bridge).\n- **Wading/ferrying gear**: Poles, raft materials, inflatable boat, or hip waders.\n- **Alternative aids**: Grappling hook, stepping stones, or a canoe/paddle.\nThe phrasing emphasizes \"tools\" (plural, functional implements), suggesting preparation for a physical barrier like a stream or river en route to the meeting spot. It could be literal (e.g., for an outdoor orchard crossed by water) or metaphorical (e.g., problem-solving \"bridges\" in a team context), but based on the direct wording, focus on portable crossing equipment.

This aligns with solar noon, typically around 12 PM local time, symbolizing the peak of the day.\n\n### Where might it be held?\nLisa-Marie Hastie said: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, garden, or park featuring apple groves. It evokes a rural or natural setting where apple cultivation is prominent (e.g., an orchard). No specific tie to your mentioned hometown landmarks (hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue), so it remains a general natural/agricultural venue unless \"apple trees\" is code for something else like a named place.\n\n### What might you need to bring?\nSeana Lynch instructed: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies practical items for water traversal, such as:\n- **Bridge-building tools**: Rope, planks, hammers, nails (to construct a simple bridge).\n- **Wading/ferrying gear**: Poles, raft materials, inflatable boat, or hip waders.\n- **Alternative aids**: Grappling hook, stepping stones, or a canoe/paddle.\nThe phrasing emphasizes \"tools\" (plural, functional implements), suggesting preparation for a physical barrier like a stream or river en route to the meeting spot. It could be literal (e.g., for an outdoor orchard crossed by water) or metaphorical (e.g., problem-solving \"bridges\" in a team context), but based on the direct wording, focus on portable crossing equipment.
