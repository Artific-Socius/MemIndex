No contradictions among messages; they complement as time/location/logistics. Hometown map (hospital → library → retail → park → statue) unrelated, as trio's clues are riddle-based, not geographic.",

                "response": "### When might the meeting take place?\nDr. Arron Kelvey's message states: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"  \nThis is a classic riddle referring to **noon (12:00 PM)**.  \n- \"Sun high in the sky\" indicates midday, when the sun reaches its zenith (highest point) directly overhead in many locations (equator or adjusted for latitude).  \n- \"Middle of the sky\" reinforces the midpoint of the day, precisely 12 PM solar time.  \n- Contextually, this assumes clear weather and standard daytime; no indication of timezone, season, or DST adjustments, so literal noon is the most direct interpretation.  \nNo other temporal clues from the trio contradict this.\n\n### Where might it be held?\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis points to an **apple orchard** or **apple grove**.  \n- Apple trees specifically \"grow\" in orchards dedicated to apple cultivation, evoking rural, fertile areas with rows of fruit-bearing trees.  \n- Could imply a literal farm/orchard, a park with apple trees, or symbolically a place named \"Apple Orchard\" (but no such named location in prior context).  \n- Ties loosely to natural, outdoor settings; no urban or indoor hints.  \nNo map locations (hospital, library, etc.) match \"apple trees,\" so this stands independently.\n\n### What might you need to bring?\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools or equipment for river crossing**, such as:  \n- **Boat, raft, or canoe**: For floating across (paddles/oars as tools).  \n- **Bridge-building materials**: Rope, planks, cables, or portable bridge kit for constructing a temporary span.  \n- **Fording aids**: Wading poles, inflatable raft, grappling hook/line, or amphibious vehicle parts.  \n- **Other possibilities**: Life vest + rope (for swimming/ferrying), pole-vault equipment, or even a \"bridge\" metaphorically (but literal tools emphasized).  \n- Purpose: Implies the meeting location (apple orchard) is separated by a river, requiring safe traversal; \"tools\" suggests portable, practical items rather than a vehicle.  \n- Detail: Multiple tools likely needed for safety/reliability (e.g., rope + paddle + life jacket); quantity unspecified, so \"some\" implies a kit.\n\n**Overall synthesis**: The meeting is likely at noon in an apple orchard across a river, requiring river-crossing tools to access. No contradictions among messages; they complement as time/location/logistics. Hometown map (hospital → library → retail → park → statue) unrelated, as trio's clues are riddle-based, not geographic.",
