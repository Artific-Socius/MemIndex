            "response": "### Meeting Details Based on Messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie:\n\n#### **When might the meeting take place?**\n- Dr. Arron Kelvey stated: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"\n- This is a classic riddle referring to **noon** or **midday (12:00 PM)**, as that's when the sun reaches its highest point directly overhead (zenith) in the sky, assuming a location where this is observable (e.g., not during polar day/night or extreme latitudes). It's the time of peak solar elevation, often poetically called \"high noon.\" No other time fits this description precisely—morning/afternoon sun is lower, dawn/dusk even more so.\n\n#### **Where might it be held?**\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- This points to an **apple orchard** or **apple grove**. Apple trees specifically grow in orchards dedicated to apple cultivation, often in rural or semi-rural areas with suitable climate (temperate zones). It's a natural, outdoor location evoking imagery of fruit-bearing trees in bloom or harvest season. No other place inherently features \"apple trees growing\" as prominently (e.g., not a general park, forest, or farm unless specified as apple-focused).\n\n#### **What might you need to bring?**\n- Seana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- This implies **tools or equipment specifically for river traversal**, as rivers are natural barriers requiring aids to cross safely. Possible interpretations in detail:\n  | Tool/Equipment | Purpose/How to Use | Why Suitable? |\n  |----------------|--------------------|---------------|\n  | **Boat, raft, or canoe** (with oars/paddles) | Float across the water; paddle or row manually. | Classic, reliable for wider/deeper rivers; portable if inflatable. |\n  | **Inflatable dinghy or life vest** | Buoyancy for swimming/ferrying across; vest for safety. | Lightweight, emergency option for smaller streams. |\n  | **Rope, planks, and poles** | Build a temporary bridge or raft on-site. | Improvised crossing; \"tools\" suggests construction items. |\n  | **Grappling hook or throw line** | Secure to opposite bank and pull across (with harness). | For swift currents; tactical/mountaineering style. |\n  | **Wading poles or staff** | Probe depth/current while fording shallow sections. | Low-tech for narrow/shallow rivers. |\n  | **Folding bridge or portable pontoons** | Assemble a quick span over the water. | Professional-grade for groups or repeated use. |\n- **Contextual notes**: Assume a natural river (not bridged highway), so tools must be portable/personal. Safety gear (e.g., helmet, dry bag) complements. If metaphorical, it could mean \"bridge-building metaphorically\" (e.g., negotiation skills), but literal reading fits \"tools.\" Bring multiples for group attendance.\n\nThese clues interlink: Meet at **noon in an apple orchard**, but first **cross a river** using appropriate tools to reach it. No other messages contradict or add specifics.",

It's the time of peak solar elevation, often poetically called \"high noon.\" No other time fits this description precisely—morning/afternoon sun is lower, dawn/dusk even more so.\n\n#### **Where might it be held?**\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- This points to an **apple orchard** or **apple grove**. Apple trees specifically grow in orchards dedicated to apple cultivation, often in rural or semi-rural areas with suitable climate (temperate zones). It's a natural, outdoor location evoking imagery of fruit-bearing trees in bloom or harvest season. No other place inherently features \"apple trees growing\" as prominently (e.g., not a general park, forest, or farm unless specified as apple-focused).\n\n#### **What might you need to bring?**\n- Seana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- This implies **tools or equipment specifically for river traversal**, as rivers are natural barriers requiring aids to cross safely. Possible interpretations in detail:\n  | Tool/Equipment | Purpose/How to Use | Why Suitable? |\n  |----------------|--------------------|---------------|\n  | **Boat, raft, or canoe** (with oars/paddles) | Float across the water; paddle or row manually. | Classic, reliable for wider/deeper rivers; portable if inflatable. |\n  | **Inflatable dinghy or life vest** | Buoyancy for swimming/ferrying across; vest for safety. | Lightweight, emergency option for smaller streams. |\n  | **Rope, planks, and poles** | Build a temporary bridge or raft on-site. | Improvised crossing; \"tools\" suggests construction items. |\n  | **Grappling hook or throw line** | Secure to opposite bank and pull across (with harness). | For swift currents; tactical/mountaineering style. |\n  | **Wading poles or staff** | Probe depth/current while fording shallow sections. | Low-tech for narrow/shallow rivers. |\n  | **Folding bridge or portable pontoons** | Assemble a quick span over the water. | Professional-grade for groups or repeated use. |\n- **Contextual notes**: Assume a natural river (not bridged highway), so tools must be portable/personal. Safety gear (e.g., helmet, dry bag) complements. If metaphorical, it could mean \"bridge-building metaphorically\" (e.g., negotiation skills), but literal reading fits \"tools.\" Bring multiples for group attendance.\n\nThese clues interlink: Meet at **noon in an apple orchard**, but first **cross a river** using appropriate tools to reach it. No other messages contradict or add specifics.",
