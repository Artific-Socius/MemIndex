It implies a precise solar time, potentially adjusted for local time zones, but literally midday.\n\n- **Location:** Lisa-Marie Hastie said, \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This suggests an **apple orchard** or a place abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation known for apple cultivation. It evokes a rural, natural setting, possibly seasonal (e.g., harvest time in fall), and could be a landmark or private property. No specific coordinates tie to your hometown descriptions (hospital, library, retail, park, statue), so it may be elsewhere or metaphorical, but taken literally, it's an orchard.\n\n- **What to bring:** Seana Lynch instructed, \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies preparation for a water obstacle, requiring **river-crossing tools** such as:\n  - A **boat, raft, or canoe** (for floating across).\n  - **Rope, grapple hook, or pulley system** (for improvised bridging or ferrying).\n  - **Wading poles, inflatable raft, or portable bridge sections** (for shallow/fast-moving rivers).\n  - Potentially **life jacket, waterproof gear, or ford-crossing aids** if safety is considered.\n  It suggests the meeting site (orchard) is accessible only after navigating a river, possibly indicating remoteness, a riddle-like challenge, or literal geography (e.g., orchard on the opposite bank).

It implies a precise solar time, potentially adjusted for local time zones, but literally midday.\n\n- **Location:** Lisa-Marie Hastie said, \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This suggests an **apple orchard** or a place abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation known for apple cultivation. It evokes a rural, natural setting, possibly seasonal (e.g., harvest time in fall), and could be a landmark or private property. No specific coordinates tie to your hometown descriptions (hospital, library, retail, park, statue), so it may be elsewhere or metaphorical, but taken literally, it's an orchard.\n\n- **What to bring:** Seana Lynch instructed, \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies preparation for a water obstacle, requiring **river-crossing tools** such as:\n  - A **boat, raft, or canoe** (for floating across).\n  - **Rope, grapple hook, or pulley system** (for improvised bridging or ferrying).\n  - **Wading poles, inflatable raft, or portable bridge sections** (for shallow/fast-moving rivers).\n  - Potentially **life jacket, waterproof gear, or ford-crossing aids** if safety is considered.\n  It suggests the meeting site (orchard) is accessible only after navigating a river, possibly indicating remoteness, a riddle-like challenge, or literal geography (e.g., orchard on the opposite bank). Multiple tools might be needed for reliability, depending on river width, depth, current, and conditions.",
