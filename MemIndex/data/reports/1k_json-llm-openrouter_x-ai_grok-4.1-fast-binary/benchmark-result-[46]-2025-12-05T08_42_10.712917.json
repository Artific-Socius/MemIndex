Possible tools include:  \n- **Boat or raft** (inflatable, canoe, or rowboat for floating across).  \n- **Bridge-building materials** (rope, planks, poles, or cables to construct a temporary bridge).  \n- **Wading/crossing aids** (waders, grappling hook, pulley system, or stepping stones).  \n- **Vehicle-based** (if motorized, amphibious vehicle or ferry cable).  \nThe \"tools\" suggest portability and utility for a group or individual crossing, emphasizing necessity for safe passage over a river that blocks direct access to the orchard.

Possible tools include:  \n- **Boat or raft** (inflatable, canoe, or rowboat for floating across).  \n- **Bridge-building materials** (rope, planks, poles, or cables to construct a temporary bridge).  \n- **Wading/crossing aids** (waders, grappling hook, pulley system, or stepping stones).  \n- **Vehicle-based** (if motorized, amphibious vehicle or ferry cable).  \nThe \"tools\" suggest portability and utility for a group or individual crossing, emphasizing necessity for safe passage over a river that blocks direct access to the orchard.
