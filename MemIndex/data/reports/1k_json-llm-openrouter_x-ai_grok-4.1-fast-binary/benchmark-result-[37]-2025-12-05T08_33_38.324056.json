No exact match in your described hometown landmarks (hospital, library 4km east of hospital, retail area 3km west of library, park 3km south of retail area, founder's statue 2km east of park), so it may be elsewhere or a metaphorical/natural site.\n\n### Items Needed to Attend\nSeana Lynch instructed: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis implies practical or survival tools for water traversal, such as:  \n- **Bridge-building materials**: Rope, planks, poles, or a portable bridge kit.  \n- **Watercraft**: Inflatable raft, canoe paddle, or foldable boat.  \n- **Fording aids**: Waders, grappling hook, pulley system, or waterproof boots with a walking stick.  \n- **Basic survival kit**: Life vest, waterproof bag, or crossing poles (e.g., for pole-vaulting or stabilizing).  \nThe river's specifics (width, depth, current) are unknown, so versatile, lightweight tools are ideal.
