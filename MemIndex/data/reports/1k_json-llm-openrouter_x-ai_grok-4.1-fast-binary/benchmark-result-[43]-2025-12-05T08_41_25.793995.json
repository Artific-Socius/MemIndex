It implies a precise solar time rather than clock time, emphasizing peak daylight.\n\n### Where it might be held:\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, garden, or rural grove known for apple cultivation. It evokes a natural, outdoor setting, possibly seasonal (e.g., harvest time in autumn), and could be idyllic or symbolic of abundance/knowledge (apple tree allusions in folklore).\n\n### What you might need to bring:\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, which could include:\n- **Portable bridge-building materials**: Planks, ropes, pulleys, or a foldable Bailey bridge kit for spanning water.\n- **Boating/inflatable options**: A small inflatable raft, kayak, canoe, oars/paddles, or a personal flotation device (PFD) with tether.\n- **Wading/ford tools**: Waders, grappling hooks, poles for probing depth/current, or a trolley system (e.g., zip-line across).\n- **Improvised aids**: Throw ropes, life buoys, carabiners, or even a portable pontoon system.\nThe emphasis on \"tools\" implies practical, man-made implements rather than natural means (e.g., not just swimming), suggesting the river may be wide, deep, swift, or obstacle-filled, necessitating preparation for safe traversal to reach the meeting site.",

It implies a precise solar time rather than clock time, emphasizing peak daylight.\n\n### Where it might be held:\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, garden, or rural grove known for apple cultivation. It evokes a natural, outdoor setting, possibly seasonal (e.g., harvest time in autumn), and could be idyllic or symbolic of abundance/knowledge (apple tree allusions in folklore).\n\n### What you might need to bring:\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, which could include:\n- **Portable bridge-building materials**: Planks, ropes, pulleys, or a foldable Bailey bridge kit for spanning water.\n- **Boating/inflatable options**: A small inflatable raft, kayak, canoe, oars/paddles, or a personal flotation device (PFD) with tether.\n- **Wading/ford tools**: Waders, grappling hooks, poles for probing depth/current, or a trolley system (e.g., zip-line across).\n- **Improvised aids**: Throw ropes, life buoys, carabiners, or even a portable pontoon system.\nThe emphasis on \"tools\" implies practical, man-made implements rather than natural means (e.g., not just swimming), suggesting the river may be wide, deep, swift, or obstacle-filled, necessitating preparation for safe traversal to reach the meeting site.",
