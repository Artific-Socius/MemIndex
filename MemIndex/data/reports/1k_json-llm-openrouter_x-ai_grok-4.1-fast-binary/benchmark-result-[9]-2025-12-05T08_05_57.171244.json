It's a classic reference to solar noon, independent of clocks, emphasizing a natural, precise midpoint of the day.\n\n#### **Location**:\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- This points to an **apple orchard** or a grove/plantation abundant with apple trees. It's a natural, rural setting where apple trees are cultivated or grow in clusters, evoking imagery of a peaceful, fruitful area possibly in a countryside or farm region.\n\n#### **What to Bring**:\n- Seana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- Required items are **tools specifically for crossing a river**, such as:\n  - **Bridge-building materials**: Planks, ropes, poles, or a portable bridge kit to construct a temporary crossing.\n  - **Boating/ferrying equipment**: Oars, a small inflatable raft, canoe paddles, or a punt pole.\n  - **Wading/fording gear**: Waders, grappling hooks, or a rope with harness for safe traversal.\n  - **Other practical tools**: A collapsible boat, life vest with tether, or even simple items like a long pole for probing depth and stability.\n- The emphasis is on preparedness for water traversal, implying the meeting site (apple orchard) is isolated by a river, requiring these to access it reliably and safely.\n\nThese details form a cohesive riddle: Meet at **noon** in an **apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools**.

It's a classic reference to solar noon, independent of clocks, emphasizing a natural, precise midpoint of the day.\n\n#### **Location**:\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- This points to an **apple orchard** or a grove/plantation abundant with apple trees. It's a natural, rural setting where apple trees are cultivated or grow in clusters, evoking imagery of a peaceful, fruitful area possibly in a countryside or farm region.\n\n#### **What to Bring**:\n- Seana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- Required items are **tools specifically for crossing a river**, such as:\n  - **Bridge-building materials**: Planks, ropes, poles, or a portable bridge kit to construct a temporary crossing.\n  - **Boating/ferrying equipment**: Oars, a small inflatable raft, canoe paddles, or a punt pole.\n  - **Wading/fording gear**: Waders, grappling hooks, or a rope with harness for safe traversal.\n  - **Other practical tools**: A collapsible boat, life vest with tether, or even simple items like a long pole for probing depth and stability.\n- The emphasis is on preparedness for water traversal, implying the meeting site (apple orchard) is isolated by a river, requiring these to access it reliably and safely.\n\nThese details form a cohesive riddle: Meet at **noon** in an **apple orchard**, bringing **river-crossing tools**. No other specifics (e.g., exact coordinates or additional items) were provided.",
