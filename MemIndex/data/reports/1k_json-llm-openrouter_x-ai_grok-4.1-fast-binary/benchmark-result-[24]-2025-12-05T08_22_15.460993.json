In standard contexts, this precisely indicates solar noon, around midday, for a scheduled event.\n\n### Where might it be held?\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation known for apple cultivation. It evokes a rural, natural setting like an orchard in bloom or harvest season, possibly symbolic of fertility/knowledge (apples in folklore), but literally a place with growing apple trees.\n\n### What might you need to bring?\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis implies items essential for traversing water, indicating the meeting site may be separated by a river or stream. Possible tools (detailed options based on practicality and context):  \n- **Boat/raft**: Inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat for floating across.  \n- **Bridge-building materials**: Rope, planks, poles, or a portable bridge kit to construct a temporary crossing.  \n- **Wading gear**: Waders, waterproof boots, or a rope bridge line if shallow.  \n- **Other aids**: Grappling hook, pulley system, or even a simple ferry pole if motorized options aren't assumed.  \nEssentially, any equipment enabling safe river traversal, suggesting the venue is accessible only by crossing water (e.g., an island orchard reached via a stream-adjacent river).

In standard contexts, this precisely indicates solar noon, around midday, for a scheduled event.\n\n### Where might it be held?\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation known for apple cultivation. It evokes a rural, natural setting like an orchard in bloom or harvest season, possibly symbolic of fertility/knowledge (apples in folklore), but literally a place with growing apple trees.\n\n### What might you need to bring?\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis implies items essential for traversing water, indicating the meeting site may be separated by a river or stream. Possible tools (detailed options based on practicality and context):  \n- **Boat/raft**: Inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat for floating across.  \n- **Bridge-building materials**: Rope, planks, poles, or a portable bridge kit to construct a temporary crossing.  \n- **Wading gear**: Waders, waterproof boots, or a rope bridge line if shallow.  \n- **Other aids**: Grappling hook, pulley system, or even a simple ferry pole if motorized options aren't assumed.  \nEssentially, any equipment enabling safe river traversal, suggesting the venue is accessible only by crossing water (e.g., an island orchard reached via a stream-adjacent river).
