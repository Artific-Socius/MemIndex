It implies midday, precise to the hour when solar noon occurs, avoiding morning, afternoon, or evening.\n\n### Where might it be held?\nLisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation dedicated to apple cultivation. Apple trees typically grow in rural or semi-rural areas with suitable climate (temperate zones), often in orchards organized in rows for harvesting. It evokes a natural, outdoor setting rather than urban—possibly private property, a public park with orchards, or a cider farm. No specific address or tie to your hometown landmarks (e.g., hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue) is mentioned, so it remains a generic orchard location.\n\n### What might you need to bring to attend this meeting?\nSeana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, implying the meeting site is separated by a body of water (river/stream) without a pre-existing bridge or ford. Possible detailed items include:  \n- **Boat/raft-building materials**: Inflatable raft, wooden planks, ropes, oars/paddles, life vests for safety.  \n- **Bridge-building tools**: Hammer, nails, lumber, ropes/cables for a simple rope bridge, pulleys, or portable Bailey bridge sections if more advanced.  \n- **Wading/crossing aids**: Waders/boots, grappling hook, long poles for probing depth/current, waterproof bags for gear.  \n- **Vehicle-based**: Foldable kayak, amphibious vehicle parts, or tow ropes if driving.  \nThe emphasis on \"tools\" (plural) suggests portable, multi-item kit rather than a single vehicle. Purpose: Safe traversal of potentially swift/cold/deep water, ensuring attendance without getting wet or risking drowning. Bring weather-appropriate gear (e.g., rain poncho) as riverside areas can be muddy/slippery.\n\nThese details are derived **exclusively** from the three individuals' messages (Seana Lynch at 07:52:08, Lisa-Marie Hastie at 07:52:54, Dr. Arron Kelvey at 07:53:47), with no assumptions from other conversation elements like TV show, shopping list, jokes, names, colors, quotes, restaurant role-play, or hometown map.

It implies midday, precise to the hour when solar noon occurs, avoiding morning, afternoon, or evening.\n\n### Where might it be held?\nLisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or plantation dedicated to apple cultivation. Apple trees typically grow in rural or semi-rural areas with suitable climate (temperate zones), often in orchards organized in rows for harvesting. It evokes a natural, outdoor setting rather than urban—possibly private property, a public park with orchards, or a cider farm. No specific address or tie to your hometown landmarks (e.g., hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue) is mentioned, so it remains a generic orchard location.\n\n### What might you need to bring to attend this meeting?\nSeana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, implying the meeting site is separated by a body of water (river/stream) without a pre-existing bridge or ford. Possible detailed items include:  \n- **Boat/raft-building materials**: Inflatable raft, wooden planks, ropes, oars/paddles, life vests for safety.  \n- **Bridge-building tools**: Hammer, nails, lumber, ropes/cables for a simple rope bridge, pulleys, or portable Bailey bridge sections if more advanced.  \n- **Wading/crossing aids**: Waders/boots, grappling hook, long poles for probing depth/current, waterproof bags for gear.  \n- **Vehicle-based**: Foldable kayak, amphibious vehicle parts, or tow ropes if driving.  \nThe emphasis on \"tools\" (plural) suggests portable, multi-item kit rather than a single vehicle. Purpose: Safe traversal of potentially swift/cold/deep water, ensuring attendance without getting wet or risking drowning. Bring weather-appropriate gear (e.g., rain poncho) as riverside areas can be muddy/slippery.\n\nThese details are derived **exclusively** from the three individuals' messages (Seana Lynch at 07:52:08, Lisa-Marie Hastie at 07:52:54, Dr. Arron Kelvey at 07:53:47), with no assumptions from other conversation elements like TV show, shopping list, jokes, names, colors, quotes, restaurant role-play, or hometown map. The instructions are cryptic/riddle-based, possibly for secrecy or testing comprehension.",
