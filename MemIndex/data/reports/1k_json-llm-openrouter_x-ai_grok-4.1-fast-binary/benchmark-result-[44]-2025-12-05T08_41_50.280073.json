It implies a precise, traditional time without modern clocks, emphasizing peak daylight.\n\n### Where it might be held:\nLisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or garden known for apple cultivation. It evokes a rural, natural setting, possibly seasonal (e.g., autumn harvest time for apples). No specific address is given, but it could tie into symbolic or local landmarks if context expands.\n\n### What you might need to bring:\nSeana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, implying a body of water (river/stream) separates the meeting point from access routes. Possible items include:  \n- **Bridge-building materials**: Planks, ropes, hammers, nails, or poles for a makeshift bridge.  \n- **Watercraft**: Inflatable raft, canoe paddle, or foldable boat.  \n- **Fording aids**: Wading poles, grappling hooks, life vests, or waterproof bags.  \n- **Other practical tools**: Winch, pulley system, or even a portable pontoon kit.  \nThe emphasis on \"tools\" (plural, practical items) suggests preparation for a physical obstacle, not just swimming—prioritizing safety and reliability for group attendance.

It implies a precise, traditional time without modern clocks, emphasizing peak daylight.\n\n### Where it might be held:\nLisa-Marie Hastie stated: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis suggests an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees, such as a farm, grove, or garden known for apple cultivation. It evokes a rural, natural setting, possibly seasonal (e.g., autumn harvest time for apples). No specific address is given, but it could tie into symbolic or local landmarks if context expands.\n\n### What you might need to bring:\nSeana Lynch stated: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, implying a body of water (river/stream) separates the meeting point from access routes. Possible items include:  \n- **Bridge-building materials**: Planks, ropes, hammers, nails, or poles for a makeshift bridge.  \n- **Watercraft**: Inflatable raft, canoe paddle, or foldable boat.  \n- **Fording aids**: Wading poles, grappling hooks, life vests, or waterproof bags.  \n- **Other practical tools**: Winch, pulley system, or even a portable pontoon kit.  \nThe emphasis on \"tools\" (plural, practical items) suggests preparation for a physical obstacle, not just swimming—prioritizing safety and reliability for group attendance.
