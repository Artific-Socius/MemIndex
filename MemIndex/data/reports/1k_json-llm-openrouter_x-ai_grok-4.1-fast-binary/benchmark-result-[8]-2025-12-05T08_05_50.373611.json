            "response": "### Meeting Details Based on Messages:\n\n#### **When might the meeting take place?**\nDr. Arron Kelvey's message states: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"  \nThis is a poetic reference to **noon** or **midday** (around 12:00 PM), when the sun reaches its zenith directly overhead in many locations (assuming a temperate latitude without extreme seasonal variations). \"High in the middle of the sky\" emphasizes the sun's peak position, ruling out dawn, dusk, or night. In 2025 contexts, this could align with solar noon, precisely calculable by longitude (e.g., ~12:00 local solar time).\n\n#### **Where might it be held?**\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis points to an **apple orchard** or **apple grove**. Apple trees (Malus domestica) typically grow in dedicated orchards, often in rural or semi-rural areas with suitable climate (temperate, well-drained soil). It evokes a natural, outdoor setting like a farm, plantation, or historical orchard. No specific hometown landmark matches directly (e.g., no \"orchard\" mentioned among hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue), so it's likely a generic or implied location, possibly symbolic of abundance/fruitfulness.\n\n#### **What might you need to bring?**\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, implying a body of water (river/stream) obstructs access to the meeting site. Possible items include:  \n- **Bridge-building tools**: Rope, planks/boards, hammers, nails, or portable bridge kits (e.g., for constructing a simple footbridge).  \n- **Fording/rafting tools**: Wading poles, inflatable raft/boat, oars/paddles, life vest, or grappling hook.  \n- **Cable/zip-line tools**: Pulley system, carabiners, harness, and anchor cables for a temporary crossing.  \n- **Amphibious aids**: Waterproof boots, walking stick for probing depth, or buoyancy aids.  \nRationale: \"Tools for crossing a river\" suggests practical, portable equipment rather than a vehicle (e.g., not a car/bridge, but components to improvise one). This could tie into the orchard location if a river borders it, making access conditional on preparation. Failure to bring them might prevent attendance.\n\n**Overall Interpretation**: The meeting appears clandestine or riddle-like (e.g., spy/thriller theme), set at **noon in an apple orchard**, requiring **river-crossing tools** for entry. No contradictions with other data (e.g., TV show, shopping list, restaurant). If hometown map integrates: Start at hospital (center) → library (+4km E) → retail (-3km W from library, so ~1km E of hospital) → park (-3km S from retail) → statue (+2km E from park); but no river/orchard noted yet.",

                "response": "### Meeting Details Based on Messages:\n\n#### **When might the meeting take place?**\nDr. Arron Kelvey's message states: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"  \nThis is a poetic reference to **noon** or **midday** (around 12:00 PM), when the sun reaches its zenith directly overhead in many locations (assuming a temperate latitude without extreme seasonal variations). \"High in the middle of the sky\" emphasizes the sun's peak position, ruling out dawn, dusk, or night. In 2025 contexts, this could align with solar noon, precisely calculable by longitude (e.g., ~12:00 local solar time).\n\n#### **Where might it be held?**\nLisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"  \nThis points to an **apple orchard** or **apple grove**. Apple trees (Malus domestica) typically grow in dedicated orchards, often in rural or semi-rural areas with suitable climate (temperate, well-drained soil). It evokes a natural, outdoor setting like a farm, plantation, or historical orchard. No specific hometown landmark matches directly (e.g., no \"orchard\" mentioned among hospital, library, retail area, park, founder's statue), so it's likely a generic or implied location, possibly symbolic of abundance/fruitfulness.\n\n#### **What might you need to bring?**\nSeana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"  \nThis requires **tools specifically for river crossing**, implying a body of water (river/stream) obstructs access to the meeting site. Possible items include:  \n- **Bridge-building tools**: Rope, planks/boards, hammers, nails, or portable bridge kits (e.g., for constructing a simple footbridge).  \n- **Fording/rafting tools**: Wading poles, inflatable raft/boat, oars/paddles, life vest, or grappling hook.  \n- **Cable/zip-line tools**: Pulley system, carabiners, harness, and anchor cables for a temporary crossing.  \n- **Amphibious aids**: Waterproof boots, walking stick for probing depth, or buoyancy aids.  \nRationale: \"Tools for crossing a river\" suggests practical, portable equipment rather than a vehicle (e.g., not a car/bridge, but components to improvise one). This could tie into the orchard location if a river borders it, making access conditional on preparation. Failure to bring them might prevent attendance.\n\n**Overall Interpretation**: The meeting appears clandestine or riddle-like (e.g., spy/thriller theme), set at **noon in an apple orchard**, requiring **river-crossing tools** for entry. No contradictions with other data (e.g., TV show, shopping list, restaurant). If hometown map integrates: Start at hospital (center) → library (+4km E) → retail (-3km W from library, so ~1km E of hospital) → park (-3km S from retail) → statue (+2km E from park); but no river/orchard noted yet.",
