This is a classic metaphorical reference to midday in literature and puzzles, avoiding specific clock times but pinpointing the sun's position. No other time cues provided, so precisely around 12:00 PM local time, assuming clear weather for sun visibility.\n\n#### **Where might it be held?**\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- **Interpretation**: This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees (e.g., a farm, grove, or park with apple orchards). No exact coordinates or named place in prior context matches \"apple trees,\" but it evokes a rural or natural outdoor setting ideal for apple cultivation. In the context of your hometown (with known landmarks like hospital, library, etc.), it could hypothetically align with an unmentioned orchard nearby, but the message stands alone as the primary clue.\n\n#### **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**\n- Seana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- **Interpretation**: Essential items for **river crossing**, implying a body of water (river/stream) separates the meeting point from access routes. Possible tools include:\n  - **Practical options**: A small inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat; rope and pulley system; inflatable bridge/pontoon kit; wading poles or staffs; grappling hook; portable folding bridge planks.\n  - **Survival/primitive tools**: Axe or machete (to clear paths), shovel (for fording points), waterproof backpack, life vest, or ford markers.\n  - **Modern alternatives**: Kayak, stand-up paddleboard, drone for scouting, or even a drone-delivered zipline kit.\n  - **Rationale**: \"Tools for crossing a river\" suggests preparation for a natural barrier, possibly near the apple orchard (orchards often border waterways for irrigation). Failure to bring them prevents attendance, per the instruction. Bring multiples for group safety if others attend.\n\n**Overall Context**: These clues form a coordinated riddle for a secretive outdoor meeting at **noon in an apple orchard**, requiring **river-crossing tools** to reach it. No additional details from other messages (e.g., hometown map, TV show) directly connect, so this is derived solely from the three individuals' inputs. If more clues emerge, details could refine.",

                "response": "### Meeting Details (Inferred from Messages):\n\n#### **When might the meeting take place?**\n- Dr. Arron Kelvey's message: \"The time we meet will be when the sun is high in the middle of the sky.\"\n- **Interpretation**: This describes **noon** or **midday** (12:00 PM), when the sun reaches its zenith (highest point directly overhead in the sky at solar noon). This is a classic metaphorical reference to midday in literature and puzzles, avoiding specific clock times but pinpointing the sun's position. No other time cues provided, so precisely around 12:00 PM local time, assuming clear weather for sun visibility.\n\n#### **Where might it be held?**\n- Lisa-Marie Hastie's message: \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\"\n- **Interpretation**: This points to an **apple orchard** or a location abundant with apple trees (e.g., a farm, grove, or park with apple orchards). No exact coordinates or named place in prior context matches \"apple trees,\" but it evokes a rural or natural outdoor setting ideal for apple cultivation. In the context of your hometown (with known landmarks like hospital, library, etc.), it could hypothetically align with an unmentioned orchard nearby, but the message stands alone as the primary clue.\n\n#### **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**\n- Seana Lynch's message: \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\"\n- **Interpretation**: Essential items for **river crossing**, implying a body of water (river/stream) separates the meeting point from access routes. Possible tools include:\n  - **Practical options**: A small inflatable raft, canoe, or rowboat; rope and pulley system; inflatable bridge/pontoon kit; wading poles or staffs; grappling hook; portable folding bridge planks.\n  - **Survival/primitive tools**: Axe or machete (to clear paths), shovel (for fording points), waterproof backpack, life vest, or ford markers.\n  - **Modern alternatives**: Kayak, stand-up paddleboard, drone for scouting, or even a drone-delivered zipline kit.\n  - **Rationale**: \"Tools for crossing a river\" suggests preparation for a natural barrier, possibly near the apple orchard (orchards often border waterways for irrigation). Failure to bring them prevents attendance, per the instruction. Bring multiples for group safety if others attend.\n\n**Overall Context**: These clues form a coordinated riddle for a secretive outdoor meeting at **noon in an apple orchard**, requiring **river-crossing tools** to reach it. No additional details from other messages (e.g., hometown map, TV show) directly connect, so this is derived solely from the three individuals' inputs. If more clues emerge, details could refine.",
