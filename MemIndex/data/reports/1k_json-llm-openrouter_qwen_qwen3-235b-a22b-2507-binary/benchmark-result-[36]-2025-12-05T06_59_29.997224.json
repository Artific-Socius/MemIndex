Therefore, the meeting is likely scheduled for **12:00 PM**.\n\n- **Where might it be held?**  \n  Lisa-Marie Hastie specified that the meeting will be \"where the apple trees grow.\" This suggests the location is an **orchard** or a **garden/area abundant with apple trees**. It could be a natural grove, a private estate, or a public park known for its apple trees.\n\n- **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**  \n  Seana Lynch emphasized that to attend, you must bring \"some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies the meeting site is not easily accessible and requires traversing a body of water. Therefore, you would need to bring **river-crossing tools**, which could include items such as:\n  - A small inflatable raft or boat\n  - Rope and harness for a zip-line or crossing aid\n  - Waders or waterproof gear\n  - Poles for stability in shallow waters\n  - Or any portable equipment suitable for safely crossing a river.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe meeting is likely set for **noon**, at a location **where apple trees grow**, such as an orchard, which may only be reached by crossing a river.

Therefore, the meeting is likely scheduled for **12:00 PM**.\n\n- **Where might it be held?**  \n  Lisa-Marie Hastie specified that the meeting will be \"where the apple trees grow.\" This suggests the location is an **orchard** or a **garden/area abundant with apple trees**. It could be a natural grove, a private estate, or a public park known for its apple trees.\n\n- **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**  \n  Seana Lynch emphasized that to attend, you must bring \"some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies the meeting site is not easily accessible and requires traversing a body of water. Therefore, you would need to bring **river-crossing tools**, which could include items such as:\n  - A small inflatable raft or boat\n  - Rope and harness for a zip-line or crossing aid\n  - Waders or waterproof gear\n  - Poles for stability in shallow waters\n  - Or any portable equipment suitable for safely crossing a river.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe meeting is likely set for **noon**, at a location **where apple trees grow**, such as an orchard, which may only be reached by crossing a river.
