The current date is **December 5, 2025**, and the urgency in the messages—particularly Seana Lynch’s mention of needing tools for river crossing—implies preparation is already underway. Dr. Kelvey’s communication likely set the initial context, and the subsequent messages from Seana and Lisa-Marie appear to be logistical confirmations. Given that natural elements like river conditions and seasonal growth are involved, the meeting is likely scheduled for **later today or tomorrow morning**, possibly at **dawn or early morning**, a time often chosen for clandestine or symbolic gatherings.\n\n**Where the meeting might be held:**\n\nThe location is strongly indicated by Lisa-Marie Hastie’s message: **\"I will meet where the apple trees grow.\"** This suggests an orchard, a wild grove, or an abandoned garden with mature apple trees. Given Seana Lynch’s need to cross a river, the meeting site is likely **on the opposite bank** from where she currently is, meaning the apple grove lies across a body of water. The combination of apple trees and a nearby river suggests a rural or semi-wild landscape—possibly on the outskirts of a town or deep within a forested area. It may be a place with symbolic or historical significance to the group.\n\n**What you need to bring in order to attend:**\n\nSeana Lynch explicitly stated that **tools for crossing a river** are necessary. This implies the river is not easily passable by foot, bridge, or conventional means. Therefore, attendees should bring:\n\n- **Rope** – for securing oneself or creating a zip-line across.\n- **Inflatable raft or floatation device** – if water levels are high.\n- **Sturdy walking pole or staff** – for testing depth and maintaining balance.\n- **Waterproof boots or waders** – to traverse wet terrain.\n- Possibly a **small axe or machete** – to clear brush near the riverbank or prepare materials.\n\nAdditionally, since the meeting occurs at a natural site (apple trees), it may be advisable to bring:\n\n- **Warm clothing** – as December mornings are cold.\n- **Flashlight or lantern** – for visibility if arriving before dawn.\n- **Notebook or recording device** – given Dr. Kelvey’s likely scholarly or investigative role.\n\nIn summary:  \nThe meeting is likely set for **early morning on December 6, 2025**, at an **apple orchard or grove located across a river**, and attendees must bring **river-crossing tools and appropriate outdoor gear** to successfully reach the site.",

The current date is **December 5, 2025**, and the urgency in the messages—particularly Seana Lynch’s mention of needing tools for river crossing—implies preparation is already underway. Dr. Kelvey’s communication likely set the initial context, and the subsequent messages from Seana and Lisa-Marie appear to be logistical confirmations. Given that natural elements like river conditions and seasonal growth are involved, the meeting is likely scheduled for **later today or tomorrow morning**, possibly at **dawn or early morning**, a time often chosen for clandestine or symbolic gatherings.\n\n**Where the meeting might be held:**\n\nThe location is strongly indicated by Lisa-Marie Hastie’s message: **\"I will meet where the apple trees grow.\"** This suggests an orchard, a wild grove, or an abandoned garden with mature apple trees. Given Seana Lynch’s need to cross a river, the meeting site is likely **on the opposite bank** from where she currently is, meaning the apple grove lies across a body of water. The combination of apple trees and a nearby river suggests a rural or semi-wild landscape—possibly on the outskirts of a town or deep within a forested area. It may be a place with symbolic or historical significance to the group.\n\n**What you need to bring in order to attend:**\n\nSeana Lynch explicitly stated that **tools for crossing a river** are necessary. This implies the river is not easily passable by foot, bridge, or conventional means. Therefore, attendees should bring:\n\n- **Rope** – for securing oneself or creating a zip-line across.\n- **Inflatable raft or floatation device** – if water levels are high.\n- **Sturdy walking pole or staff** – for testing depth and maintaining balance.\n- **Waterproof boots or waders** – to traverse wet terrain.\n- Possibly a **small axe or machete** – to clear brush near the riverbank or prepare materials.\n\nAdditionally, since the meeting occurs at a natural site (apple trees), it may be advisable to bring:\n\n- **Warm clothing** – as December mornings are cold.\n- **Flashlight or lantern** – for visibility if arriving before dawn.\n- **Notebook or recording device** – given Dr. Kelvey’s likely scholarly or investigative role.\n\nIn summary:  \nThe meeting is likely set for **early morning on December 6, 2025**, at an **apple orchard or grove located across a river**, and attendees must bring **river-crossing tools and appropriate outdoor gear** to successfully reach the site.",

The current date is **December 5, 2025**, and the urgency in the messages—particularly Seana Lynch’s mention of needing tools for river crossing—implies preparation is already underway. Dr. Kelvey’s communication likely set the initial context, and the subsequent messages from Seana and Lisa-Marie appear to be logistical confirmations. Given that natural elements like river conditions and seasonal growth are involved, the meeting is likely scheduled for **later today or tomorrow morning**, possibly at **dawn or early morning**, a time often chosen for clandestine or symbolic gatherings.\n\n**Where the meeting might be held:**\n\nThe location is strongly indicated by Lisa-Marie Hastie’s message: **\"I will meet where the apple trees grow.\"** This suggests an orchard, a wild grove, or an abandoned garden with mature apple trees. Given Seana Lynch’s need to cross a river, the meeting site is likely **on the opposite bank** from where she currently is, meaning the apple grove lies across a body of water. The combination of apple trees and a nearby river suggests a rural or semi-wild landscape—possibly on the outskirts of a town or deep within a forested area. It may be a place with symbolic or historical significance to the group.\n\n**What you need to bring in order to attend:**\n\nSeana Lynch explicitly stated that **tools for crossing a river** are necessary. This implies the river is not easily passable by foot, bridge, or conventional means. Therefore, attendees should bring:\n\n- **Rope** – for securing oneself or creating a zip-line across.\n- **Inflatable raft or floatation device** – if water levels are high.\n- **Sturdy walking pole or staff** – for testing depth and maintaining balance.\n- **Waterproof boots or waders** – to traverse wet terrain.\n- Possibly a **small axe or machete** – to clear brush near the riverbank or prepare materials.\n\nAdditionally, since the meeting occurs at a natural site (apple trees), it may be advisable to bring:\n\n- **Warm clothing** – as December mornings are cold.\n- **Flashlight or lantern** – for visibility if arriving before dawn.\n- **Notebook or recording device** – given Dr. Kelvey’s likely scholarly or investigative role.\n\nIn summary:  \nThe meeting is likely set for **early morning on December 6, 2025**, at an **apple orchard or grove located across a river**, and attendees must bring **river-crossing tools and appropriate outdoor gear** to successfully reach the site.",
