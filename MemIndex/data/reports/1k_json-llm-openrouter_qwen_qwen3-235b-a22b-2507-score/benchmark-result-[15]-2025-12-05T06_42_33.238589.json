This usually falls around 12:00 PM local time, depending on location and time of year. Therefore, the meeting is likely scheduled for **noon**.\n\n- **Where might it be held?**  \n  Lisa-Marie Hastie specified the location as \"where the apple trees grow.\" This suggests the meeting will take place in an area with apple trees, such as an **orchard, a rural grove, a garden, or a farm** where apple trees are cultivated.\n\n- **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**  \n  Seana Lynch mentioned that attendees must bring \"some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies the meeting location is not easily accessible and requires traversing a body of water. Possible tools could include a **raft, inflatable boat, oars, waders, rope, or other river-crossing equipment**, depending on the river’s size and flow.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe meeting is likely scheduled for **noon**, to be held at an **apple orchard or grove**, and attendees must bring **tools to cross a river** to reach the site.",

Possible tools could include a **raft, inflatable boat, oars, waders, rope, or other river-crossing equipment**, depending on the river’s size and flow.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe meeting is likely scheduled for **noon**, to be held at an **apple orchard or grove**, and attendees must bring **tools to cross a river** to reach the site.",
