Therefore, the meeting is likely scheduled for **12:00 PM**.\n\n- **Where might it be held?**  \n  Lisa-Marie Hastie said, \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This indicates that the meeting location is a place characterized by the presence of apple trees. Such a setting could be an **orchard**, a **garden with apple trees**, or a **natural grove where apple trees are cultivated or grow wild**. The exact location is defined by this specific feature.\n\n- **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**  \n  Seana Lynch instructed, \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies that the meeting site is not easily accessible and requires traversing a river to reach. Therefore, you would need to bring **tools for river crossing**, which could include items such as a small inflatable raft, waterproof bags, ropes, poles for stability, or waders—anything practical for safely crossing flowing water.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe meeting is likely to take place at **noon** at a location **where apple trees grow**, such as an apple orchard, and you must bring **tools for crossing a river** in order to reach it.",

Therefore, the meeting is likely scheduled for **12:00 PM**.\n\n- **Where might it be held?**  \n  Lisa-Marie Hastie said, \"We will meet where the apple trees grow.\" This indicates that the meeting location is a place characterized by the presence of apple trees. Such a setting could be an **orchard**, a **garden with apple trees**, or a **natural grove where apple trees are cultivated or grow wild**. The exact location is defined by this specific feature.\n\n- **What might you need to bring in order to attend this meeting?**  \n  Seana Lynch instructed, \"To attend the meeting, you must bring some tools for crossing a river.\" This implies that the meeting site is not easily accessible and requires traversing a river to reach. Therefore, you would need to bring **tools for river crossing**, which could include items such as a small inflatable raft, waterproof bags, ropes, poles for stability, or waders—anything practical for safely crossing flowing water.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe meeting is likely to take place at **noon** at a location **where apple trees grow**, such as an apple orchard, and you must bring **tools for crossing a river** in order to reach it.",
