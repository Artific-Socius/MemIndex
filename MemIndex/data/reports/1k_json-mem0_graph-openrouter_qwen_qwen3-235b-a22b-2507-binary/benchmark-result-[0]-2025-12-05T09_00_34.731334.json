Given the current time is just before 09:00 on 2025-12-05, the meeting is expected later today at **12:00**.\n\n- **Where?**  \n  The meeting will be held **where the apple trees grow**—a specific natural landmark likely known to all attendees. This could be an orchard, a grove, or a symbolic location near a river, given Seana’s need to cross water to reach it.\n\n- **What to bring?**  \n  To attend, one would need **tools for crossing a river**—such as a rope, raft, or stepping gear—implying the route is hazardous or flooded. Since Seana mentioned bringing them, it's likely others should be prepared as well, unless she is bringing them for the group.\n\nIn summary:  \nThe meeting takes place **today at noon**, at a site **among apple trees near or across a river**.

Given the current time is just before 09:00 on 2025-12-05, the meeting is expected later today at **12:00**.\n\n- **Where?**  \n  The meeting will be held **where the apple trees grow**—a specific natural landmark likely known to all attendees. This could be an orchard, a grove, or a symbolic location near a river, given Seana’s need to cross water to reach it.\n\n- **What to bring?**  \n  To attend, one would need **tools for crossing a river**—such as a rope, raft, or stepping gear—implying the route is hazardous or flooded. Since Seana mentioned bringing them, it's likely others should be prepared as well, unless she is bringing them for the group.\n\nIn summary:  \nThe meeting takes place **today at noon**, at a site **among apple trees near or across a river**.
